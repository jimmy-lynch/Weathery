# Weathery
### By Jimmy Lynch

This is a simple weather display application, utilizing OpenWeather API to draw the data. This project was done to practice using API calls and the MVVM design pattern.

Key concepts utilized include:
- MVVM
- ScrollView
- @StateObject and @ObservableObject
- @Binding, @State

Improvement reflection:
- Could better display the weather views, using more balanced features instead of hard coding padding.
- Should add a remove option for when you add a city to view.
